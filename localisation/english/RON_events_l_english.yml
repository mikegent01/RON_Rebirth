This causes further unrest and instability, and France falls into a state of anarchy. The country becomes a failed state and is no longer able to function."

1france.2.d:0 "As of January 1, 1700, France is facing various challenges in its economy. The country is still recovering from the effects of costly wars and lavish spending by the monarchy. The national debt is a significant concern, as it has grown substantially due to these factors.Agricultural production, while significant, is also facing difficulties. Outdated feudal practices and inefficient farming techniques hinder productivity and limit the potential for growth in the agricultural sector. Unemployment is a persistent issue as well, particularly among the lower classes. Economic opportunities are limited, and the heavy taxation imposed by the monarchy further burdens the common people. At this time, the French government is seeking ways to address these challenges and stabilize the economy. Reforms in taxation, trade, and agriculture are often considered and implemented to varying degrees of success. However, it will take further time and efforts to see substantial improvements and economic growth in France."
