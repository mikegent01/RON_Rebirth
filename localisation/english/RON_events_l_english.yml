france.1.t:0 "France Collapses"
france.1.d:0 "France collapses due to not stabilizing its economy and splits up into many different states. The country is in chaos, and there are frequent outbreaks of violence and rioting. The people are starving and desperate, and the government is unable to control the situation. France begins to fragment into smaller states, each controlled by different factions. This causes further unrest and instability, and France falls into a state of anarchy. The country becomes a failed state and is no longer able to function."
