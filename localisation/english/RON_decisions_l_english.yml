FRA_situations_worsens:0 "Economic Slowdown "
FRA_situations_worsens_desc:0"We must fix this situation in terms of money. If the French economy does not stabilize, then the country will face a humanitarian crisis and its people will suffer. The French government must take immediate action to improve the economic situation, or else the situation will continue to deteriorate and the French people will become more and more desperate. This is a matter of national security, and the French government must act swiftly and decisively to ensure that the country does not disintegrate due to economic hardship."

FRA_situations_worsensII:0 "The Situation Worsens"
FRA_situations_worsensII_desc:0"The economic situation in France is worsening in the years after the Seven Hour War. The country has been badly damaged by the war and its economy is in shambles. The cost of rebuilding is astronomical and the French people are hungry and desperate. The French government is trying its best to stabilize the situation, but it is an uphill battle. The people are becoming more and more restless, and there are many who feel like the government is not doing enough to help them. It will take many years before the situation in France will be back to normal, and even then there will be scars that will never quite heal."

FRA_situations_worsensIII:0 "The Situation continues to Worsen"
FRA_situations_worsensIII_desc:0"The economic situation in France is continuing to worsen in the years after the Seven Hour War. The country is still severely damaged by the war and its economy is in a state of constant crisis. The cost of rebuilding is astronomical, and the French people are struggling just to get by. The French government is trying its best to stabilize the situation, but they are struggling to contain the increasingly desperate and angry population. The longer the crisis continues, the more it seems like a revolution may be inevitable."

FRA_situations_worsensIV:0 "Protests Begin"
FRA_situations_worsensIV_desc:0"Protests have started across France over the government's failure to address the economic crisis. Thousands of people have taken to the streets to demand that their needs are met. The situation is becoming increasingly tense, and there is a growing fear that the protests might escalate into violence. The government has so far been unable to quell the protests, and it remains to be seen how they will respond if the situation continues to escalate."

FRA_situations_worsensV:0 "Protests Escalate"
FRA_situations_worsensV_desc:0"The protests in France over the government's failure to address the economic crisis have escalated into violence. There have been several clashes between protesters and police, and the number of casualties is rising. The situation is becoming increasingly tense, and there is a growing fear that the protests will escalate into a full-blown revolution. If that happens, it will be a disaster for the country and the government could be overthrown. The government needs to act quickly to quell the protests, or there will be a bloody Civil War."

FRA_situations_worsensVI:0 "French Collapse"
FRA_situations_worsensVI_desc:0"Several French regions have declared their independence from the central government in Paris. They have seceded from the country and are now governed by their own local authorities. This is a major setback for the French government, which will now have to deal with the new independent regions while also trying to quall the ongoing protests and violence. If the situation in France continues to deteriorate, the country could be split apart and the French people could be left with nothing but ruins and chaos."
